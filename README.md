# @baltpeter/prettier-config

> The Prettier config I use for my projects.

This package contains the Prettier config I use for my projects. You probably don't want to use this unless you're working on a project with me.

## Usage

Install Prettier and this config:

```sh
yarn add --dev prettier @baltpeter/prettier-config
```

Then, add the following to your `package.json`:

```json
{
    "prettier": "@baltpeter/prettier-config"
}
```
